# Local Cluster Networks for Accelerating Relief efforts

## Idea
During a natural calamity, one of the biggest challenges is communication. Most of the times, network connections in affected areas is very weak or close to non-existent. Our solution proposes the creation of cluster networks through WiFi Hotspots over a certain region which will enable affected victims of that area to come together to share critical information and help bring aid at a faster pace for all of them.

## In detail
The solution allows for groups of people in different areas of an affected region to form clusters among themselves through the creation of WiFi Hotspots. This channel of communication will help affected victims to know where the other affected victims are, allowing them to send critical information among themselves. As more and more people connect to this cluster, more information can be shared and ultimately relief aid can be brought to the members of this cluster.
