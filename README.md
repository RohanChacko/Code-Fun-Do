# Local Cluster Networks for Accelerating Relief efforts

## Idea

During a natural calamity, one of the biggest challenges is communication. Most of the times, network connections in affected areas is very weak or close to non-existent. Our solution proposes the creation of cluster networks through WiFi Hotspots over a certain region which will enable affected victims of that area to come together to share critical information and help bring aid at a faster pace for all of them.

## Detail

The solution allows for groups of people in different areas of an affected region to form clusters among themselves through the creation of WiFi Hotspots. This channel of communication will help affected victims to know where the other affected victims are, allowing them to send critical information among themselves. As more and more people connect to this cluster, more information can be shared and ultimately relief aid can be brought to the members of this cluster.

## Features

- The mobile application would enable a peer to peer Wi-Fi signal.
- Detect the location of all the available networks close by and exchange information in the background.
- Create a cluster mapping to know the position of the victims and display it on a map api.
- Information Update
  - Update the location of the person done by the app.
  - Modify the attention and critical alert levels and share the information with the other devices on the network.
- Find any device that has internet connectivity and upload the information of the main base camp server.
- The server at the base camp can then channel search teams and resources accordingly.
